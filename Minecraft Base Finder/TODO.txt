Switching to CMake
- Main projects
	- Create CMakeLists.txt
		- Add external libraries as dependencies
	- Set up vcpkg (json file)
- External libraries
	- Zlib/Zlib-ng - Get with vcpkg (will be in vcpkg_installed), then find_package
		- Should be prebuilt
	- libnbt++ - Get with FetchContent()
		- Can't be prebuilt, use CMake (CMakeLists.txt already exists)
NOTE: "external" folder will no longer be needed after dependencies are configured with CMake, they will be automatically downloaded.

How does Qt work with CMake? Does it check for existence through vcpkg? Some other way? - Default paths set during installation
